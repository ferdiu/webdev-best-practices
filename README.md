# **Web Application Development Best Practices Guide**

This is a simple guide to help you get started with web application development. It covers the basics of web development, including project setup, version control, code quality, testing, security, and deployment. Most of the information are common to software development in general, but I will try to keep it as Laravel-specific as possible (I never used Laravel btw).

### 1. **Project Initialisation & Version Control**

- **Version Control System (VCS)**: Always use a VCS like Git to track changes and manage code.
- **Repository Structure**:
  - Follow a clear branch strategy such as [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), or [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).
  - Maintain a protected `main` or `production` branch for stable releases.
  - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/payment-crash`).
  - Use tags to mark significant milestones (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
  - [Merge/Pull requests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23076923/what-is-a-merge-request#answer-36666408) are better than merging directly into `main`.
- **Commit Practices**:
  - Write meaningful commit messages (e.g., "Add login validation to user module").
  - Commit small, atomic changes frequently.
- **PHP Example**: Use tools like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket** to host Laravel project repositories.
- **Do not commit secrets**: never ever `git add .`! NEVER! Always check what you are committing and maybe use `git add -p` to review every change before staging it.

### 2. **Static Code Analysis**

- Implement static code analysis tools to maintain code quality and detect vulnerabilities early:
  - Use [**SonarQube**](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/), [**PHPStan**](https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan), [**PHP_CodeSniffer**](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer), [**Larastan**](https://github.com/larastan/larastan) or [**PHP Insights**](https://github.com/nunomaduro/phpinsights) for PHP projects.
- Automate code analysis as part of CI/CD pipelines.
- Define and enforce code formatting and linting rules; see [**Laravel's coding guidelines**](https://xqsit94.github.io/laravel-coding-guidelines/) (you can help yourself using tools like [**Laravel Pint**](https://github.com/laravel/pint)).
- **Remember**: you won’t be a better programmer by not making mistakes, but by **KNOWING** you will make them and using tools that help you catch them before they reach production.

### 3. **Testing Strategy**

- [**Unit Tests**](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing):
  - Focus on testing individual functions or components.
  - Use frameworks such as [**PHPUnit**](https://phpunit.de/index.html), which integrates well with Laravel.
- **[Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing)/[Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) Tests**:
  - Test how different modules or services interact.
  - Use Laravel’s built-in testing capabilities with [**TestResponse**](https://laravel.com/api/11.x/Illuminate/Testing/TestResponse.html) for HTTP tests.
- **Mocking**:
  - Isolate components by mocking external dependencies using [**Mockery**](https://github.com/mockery/mockery).
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Aim for at least 80% code coverage (remember 20-80 rules?).
- Automate testing as part of the CI pipeline.
- **Debugger**: If you are stuffing your code with `print`, `console.log` etc maybe it is time to someone called debugger.

### 4. **Containerisation**

- **Docker**:
  - Use Docker to create reproducible development environments.
  - Write clear, minimal [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/dockerfile/).
- **Container Management**:
  - Use [**docker-compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to manage Laravel applications alongside services like MySQL and Redis.
  - For production, consider orchestrators like [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/it/) or [**Docker Swarm**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).
- Ensure security best practices, such as minimising [privileged containers](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#privileged).

### 5. **Environment Configuration & Secrets Management**

- Store configuration values in environment variables.
- Use tools such as [**dotenv**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), which is built into Laravel for environment configuration.

### 6. **Deployment & SSH Key Management**

- [**SSH Keys for Development**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account):
  - Generate and use separate SSH keys for personal and work environments.
  - Avoid sharing private keys; use password-protected keys (especially on shared servers, do not trust `root`!).
- [**SSH Keys for Deployment**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys):
  - Configure secure access for servers and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Rotate keys periodically and revoke unused ones.
- **Laravel Example**: Set up secure deployment with [**Envoy**](https://github.com/laravel/envoy) or self-managed deployment scripts using SSH.

### 7. **CI/CD Automation ([Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)/[Continuous Deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment))**

- Automate build, test, and deployment processes using tools like [**GitHub Actions**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions), [**GitLab CI**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [**Jenkins**](https://www.jenkins.io/).
- Define pipelines for:
  - [Code linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) and [formatting checks](https://prettier.io/)
  - [Static program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)
  - [Automated testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation)
  - Deployment to staging and production environments

### 8. **Security Best Practices**

- Perform regular [vulnerability scans](https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools).
- Use dependency management tools like **Composer** to avoid outdated packages with security risks.
- Enforce **HTTPS** for all applications.
- Apply secure coding guidelines (e.g., [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)).
- **Laravel Example**: Utilise [**Laravel Sanctum**](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sanctum) or [**Passport**](https://www.passportjs.org/docs/) for API security and authentication.

### 9. **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing**

- Maintain comprehensive documentation:
  - Code documentation with tools like [**PHPDoc**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc), inspired by [**Javadoc**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc).
  - System design diagrams and flowcharts with different level of details (e.g. [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) using [**PlantUML**](https://plantuml.com/) and [**docthing**](https://github.com/ferdiu/docthing/)).
  - README files with setup and usage instructions.
- **Encourage internal knowledge-sharing sessions**.

### 10. **Monitoring & Performance Optimisation**

- Implement logging and monitoring using tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**.
- Use [**Laravel Telescope**](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/telescope) for real-time application monitoring.
- Conduct regular performance reviews and optimise code and infrastructure.

### 11. **Team Communication Best Practices**

Last but not least, let's talk about communication.

As you can see there is a lot to do, and it is easy to get lost in the details. This is why you **have to** be a team player. _There is no good software without a good team_. A good team is a team that communicates well:
- Foster clear and transparent [communication across the development team](https://fullscale.io/blog/effective-communication-in-software-development/).
- Hold daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, roadblocks, and goals.
- Encourage the use of collaborative tools for effective task management.
- **Task Management Example**: Utilise **ClickUp** to _organise tasks_, _set deadlines_, and _track project progress_. Features like task assignments, status updates, and sprint management can streamline communication and improve project efficiency.
- Maintain an open feedback culture to continuously improve workflows and team dynamics.
- **Always ask why, and never assume**: _Asking why_ will bring to discussion and discussion will lead to better solutions.

By adhering to these best practices, teams can ensure the delivery of high-quality, secure, and scalable web applications.
